# Hangman
This is a hangman game made with python and pygame.

## Abstract

Hangman is a guessing game, where the program selects a random english word, and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 
This version is getting the word from local .txt file. The words in the words.txt document were taken from a database of 5000 words, which are the most commonly used in English, and the words such as the adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions were eliminated.

## Requirements

+ Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download/releases/)
+ Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
+ Install [PyGame 1.9x](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## How to Play ?

1. Download and extract repository.
2. Run hangman.exe

You can add more words to the words.txt file

## Future Possibilities

We can implement a version where we can  get the word from WordsAPI randomly and little bit more hard to solve.
